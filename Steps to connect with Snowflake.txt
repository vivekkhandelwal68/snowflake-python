Steps to connect with Snowflake

1) Download snowflake python connector.
    --pip install snowflake-connector-python

2) import connector in python program
    --import snowflake.connector as sf

3)Create a configuration file and define below given variables and import this file in our main program.
    --account=''
    --user=''
    --password=''
    --warehouse=''
    --database=''
    --schema=''

4) create a connection object
    --conn=sf.connect(user=config.user, password=config.password, account=config.account)

5)define two methods sf_execute and sf_excute_getresult
    sf_execute : execute query and does not return any result. Good for setting up Snowflake 
    configuration like warehouse, database, schema and role.
    sf_excute_getresult : execute query and return any result in the form of cursor object.

    sample call of above given functions:
    func(connection, query)

6) Set the configuration of Snowflake.

7) Call these function as per requirement and pass connection object and query.

8) connection object is used to create cursor object. With the help execute method of cursor object,
   we can execute query on Snowflake. The datatype of upcoming result is dependent 
   upon type of cursor we created. The default cursor type return result in form of tuples. 
   We can get result in form of a dictionary by creating DictCursor cursor.
